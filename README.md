To set up SFML on local machine:
Go to https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ and download the GCC 7.3.0 MinGW (SEH) - 64 bit. Current SFML is version 2.5.1

Also download MinGW Builds 7.3.0 (64-bit) in the red rectangle. You'll need 7-zip to extract the file.

Extract both the SFML and MinGW files and move them to the same directory where you'll have the project, for example C:/

Lastly, set up MinGW in your preferred IDE.
